From the Song of Songs
!Song 4:1-4.
 How beautiful art thou, my love, how beautiful art thou! thy eyes are doves'~
eyes, besides what is hid within. thy hair is as flocks of goats, which Come up~
from mount Galaad.
2 thy teeth as flocks of sheep, that are shorn which come up from the washing,~
all with twins, and there is none barren among them.
3 thy lips are as a scarlet lace: and thy speech sweet. thy cheeks are as a~
piece of a pomegranate, besides that which lieth hid within.
4 thy neck, is as the tower of David, which is built with bulwarks: a thousand~
bucklers hang upon it, all the armour of valiant men.

!Song 4:7-10
7 Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee.
8 Come from Libanus, my spouse, come from Libanus, come: thou shalt be crowned~
from the top of Amana, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the dens of the~
lions, from the mountains of the leopards.
9 Thou hast wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse, thou hast wounded my heart~
with one of thy eyes, and with one hair of thy neck.
10 How beautiful are thy breasts, my sister, my spouse! thy breasts are more~
beautiful than wine, and the sweet smell of thy ointments above all aromatical~
spices.

!Song 4:11-15
11 thy lips, my spouse, are as a dropping honeycomb, honey and milk are under~
thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments, as the smell of frankincense.
12 My sister, my spouse, is a garden enclosed, a garden enclosed, a fountain~
sealed up.
13 thy plants are a paradise of pomegranates with the fruits of the orchard.~
Cypress with spikenard.
14 Spikenard and saffron, sweet cane and cinnamon, with all the trees of Libanus,~
myrrh and aloes with all the chief perfumes.
15 The fountain of gardens: the well of living waters, which run with a strong~
stream from Libanus.

Aderant tunc cum Apostolis sanctissimus Timotheus, primus episcopus Ephesiorum,~
et Dionysius Areopagita, sicut ipse testatur in iis, quae de beato Hierotheo,~
qui ipse quoque tunc aderat, scripsit ad praedictum Timotheum, sic dicens: Nam~
etiam apud ipsos a Deo afflatos sacrorum antistites, quando nos quoque, ut nosti,~
et multi ex sanctis nostris fratribus, ad contuendum corpus, quod vitae~
principium dedit, et Deum suscepit, convenissemus (aderat autem et Domini frater~
Jacobus, et Petrus, suprema et antiquissima theologdrum summitas): et viso sacro~
corpore, placuit omnibus, prout quisque poterat, hymnis celebrare infinitam~
bonitatem divinae potentiae.

[Lectio7]
From the holy Gospel according to Luke.
!Luke 10:38-42
In that time Jesus entered into a certain town: and a certain woman named Martha, received him into her house. And so on.
_
Homily of St. Augustine bishop of Hyppo
!Ex Serm. 27. de Verbis Dom., paulo ante medium.
Bene Martha circa corporalem Domini, quid dicam, necessitatem, an voluntatem?~
ministrebat carni mortali. Sed quis erat in carne mortali? In principio erat~
Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum. Ecce quod Maria audiebat.~
Verbum caro factum est, et habitavit in nobis. Ecce Martha cui ministrabat. Ergo~
Maria meliorem partem elegit, quae non auferetur ab ea. Hoc enim elegit, quod~
semper manebit, ideo non auferetur ab ea.

!Commemoratio S. Agapito Mart.
Agapitus was a young man of Palestrina, who eagerly accepted martyrdom at the age of fifteen years, under the Emperor Aurelian. On account of his firmness in his religion, the Emperor ordered him first to receive an exceedingly long hiding with cat-gut, and then to be thrown into a foul dungeon, where he remained for four days without food. Being brought out of prison, live embers were put upon his head, but, whereas he still gave God thanks, he was whipped again, and hung up naked by the feet, in such wise that a thick smoke from a fire kindled under his face might pour into his mouth. Afterwards, boiling water was poured upon his belly, and his jaws were broken. Then presently the judge fell from his judgement seat, and shortly after died. Whereupon the Emperor was enraged, and commanded the holy youth to be thrown to wild beasts, but these dared not to touch him, and he was stricken by the sword at Palestrina.
