Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 16:5-14
16:5 But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?
16:6 But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
16:7 But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
16:8 And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment.
16:9 Of sin: because they believed not in me.
16:10 And of justice: because I go to the Father; and you shall see me no longer.
16:11 And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged.
16:12 I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now.
16:13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you.
16:14 He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you.
