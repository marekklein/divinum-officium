The message of God to the Virgin was a mystery, which it was not lawful for the~
mouth of men, but only of angels, to utter. For the first time on earth the~
words are spoken The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee. The holy maiden heareth,~
and believeth. At length she saith Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me~
according to thy word. Here is an example of lowliness, here is a pattern of~
true devotion. At the very moment that she is told she is chosen to be the~
mother of the Lord she at once declareth herself His handmaid. The knowledge~
that she was mother of God caused in the heart of Mary only an act of humility.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord, the Ruler, cometh quickly.
* And His name shall be called Emmanuel.
V. In His days shall righteousness flourish, and abundance of peace.
R. And His name shall be called Emmanuel.
&Gloria
R. And His name shall be called Emmanuel.

Behold the handmaid * of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.
